world can manipulate temperature >> 3 different worlds
    low, medium, high

    Pipes in walls, wall space, wall surface, etc
        two grubby surfaces/ food patches

    3 configurations ?
        1) Mostly pipe
        2) 1/2 Pipe, 1/2 Wall
        3) Lots of Wall, less Pipe


4 Distincitive biomes

    -All are going to be effected by change overtime
        climate change, impact of warming climate
    -Changes of habitat
        which occur overtime.

Amount of pipes and walls need to be distinct
